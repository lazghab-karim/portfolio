              <p> 
                Welcome to my portfolio! This is a professional summary of all of the things that I enjoy doing!
                <br/><br/>
                I live in Tunisia and study computer science. I enjoy participating in coding competitions, building AI projects,
                and studying how complex systems work. Iâ€™m driven by curiosity and a
                love for elegant software design.
                <br/><br/>
                I call myself an "all-end" engineer, because I do a little bit of everything. From front-end, to backend, to infrastructure, I do it all!
                I am also learning AI architectures and Cybersecurity.
                <br/><br/>
